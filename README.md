# Week 9 Reflections
I thought the assignment for this week was pretty interesting to compare two different methods of raster analysis. I had a much easier time completing the python raster analysis in the ArcGIS environment because you don't need to set your working directory or install any additional software to do the analyses that I wanted to do. I just did two simple raster calculations to find the NDVI and the SAVI which are two environmental calculations that can give you information about the health of the ecosystem. I followed tutorials that I found to complete the analysis in both environments. The experience of using Python in ArcGIS is much more user accessible than using Rasterio and GeoPandas because Python is already fully integrated into the ArcGIS environment. However, once I loaded all the programs and set the working directly, the experience was similar.
To be completely transparent, I have not done too much work on the final project. I have a small library of sources that I have begun to read through and an idea of where to find the data for my project idea. I plan to work on it a lot this week since I'll have more time with the few days off for the holiday. I will be collecting data and loading them into a GIS software this week, hopefully.
